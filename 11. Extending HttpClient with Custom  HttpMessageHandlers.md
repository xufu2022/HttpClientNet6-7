# Extending HttpClient with Custom HttpMessageHandlers

- The delegating handler pattern
- Implementing a custom delegating handler to enable a retry policy
- Implementing a custom handler to enable unit testing 
- Additional use cases

## Implementing a Retry Policy

Requests might fail due to a network hiccup or temporary connection issue
- A retry policy enables retrying a failed request (for a set number of times)

Implementing a retry policy with a custom delegating handler

## Unit Testing with HttpClient

Testing a piece of code that includes an HTTP call can lead to integration testing instead of unit testing, and additional costs
- A custom handler can eliminate the actual API call and return a custom response

## Additional Use Cases

- Authentication handler for working with access tokens E.g: IdentityModel.AspNetCore
- Client-side caching
- Polly

# Summary

Custom handlers (delegating or not) allow us to create a pipeline through which requests and responses flow

Delegating handlers should derive from DelegatingHandler

Handlers that donâ€™t require a pipeline should derive from HttpMessageHandler
