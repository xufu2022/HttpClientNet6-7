# Handling Common Types of Integration (CRUD)

## Working with Headers and Content Negotiation

HTTP headers allow passing additional information with each request or response
- name : value
- name : partial value1, partial value2

## Working with Headers and Content Negotiation

> Request headers

Contain information on the resource to be fetched, or about the client itself 

Are provided by the client

Accept: application/json
Accept: application/json, text/html

> Response headers

Contain information on the generated response, or about the server

Are provided by the server

Content-Type: application/json

Be as strict as possible!
- For example, setting an Accept header 
(obligatory in RESTful systems) improves reliability


## Content negotiation

The mechanism used for serving different representations of a resource at the same URI

Content negotiation is driven by
- Accept
- Accept-Encoding
- Accept-Language
- Accept-Charset

Indicating Preference with the Relative Quality Parameter

Equal preference
- Accept: application/json, application/xml
Indicating preference
- Accept: application/json, application/xml;q=0.9

Providing default values for HttpClient and JsonSerializerOptions

## Setting Request Headers

HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders
HttpRequestMessage.Headers
HttpRequestMessage.Content.Headers

## Inspecting Content Types

HttpRequestMessage.Content : HttpContent
Use a derived class that matches the content of the message

- StringContent, ObjectContent, ByteArrayContent, StreamContent, …
- Optimized for their type of content

## Updating a resource

## Summary

Shortcuts can come in handy, but if you need full control it’s best to use **HttpRequestMessage** directly
