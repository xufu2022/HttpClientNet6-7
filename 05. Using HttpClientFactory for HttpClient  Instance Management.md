# Using HttpClientFactory for HttpClient Instance Management

> The Problem with Disposing HttpClient Instances (Part 1)

When disposing HttpClient the underlying SocketsHttpHandler is disposed, which closes the underlying connection

- Reopening the connection is slow
- As it takes time to close a connection, we might not have a socket available for a new one

> The Problem with Disposing HttpClient Instances (Part2)

When we reuse HttpClient/SocketsHttpHandler instances (and thus the connection), DNS changes aren’t honored

- Can lead to requests not arriving at the correct server
- Leads to issues when using Azure PaaS services

## HttpClientFactory

Factory used to create and manage instances of HttpClient and underlying handler(s)

HttpClientFactory ----------> HttpClient ----------------> HttpMessageHandler Pool --------------> API


## Introducing HttpClientFactory

Reusing handlers allows reusing the underlying connection, which solves the socket issue

Disposing of handlers after 2 minutes (=default) solves the DNS issue

HttpClientFactory provides a central location for naming and configuring logical HttpClients

For these, we can configure handlers and policies

```csharp
// register services
services.AddHttpClient();
// instantiate 
_httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
```

## Using HttpClientFactory to Manage HttpClient Instances

```csharp
// register services & client
services.AddHttpClient("MoviesAPIClient", configureClient =>
{
// configure the client
})
// instantiate 
_httpClientFactory.CreateClient("MoviesAPIClient");
```

Named clients allow working with multiple clients & configuring default settings
Named clients are registered with a string as key

Typed clients allow working with multiple clients & configuring default settings
Typed clients are registered with a type as key

**Configuring HttpClients**

Using typed HttpClient instances with type-scoped configuration
Extending typed HttpClient instances with interaction methods

## Problems with HttpClient
- When we dispose HttpClient the underlying SocketsHttpHandler is disposed, which closes the underlying connection
- When we reuse the connection, DNS changes aren’t honored
