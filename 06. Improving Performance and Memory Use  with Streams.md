# Improving Performance and Memory Use with Streams

## Stream

An abstraction of a sequence of bytes, such as a file, an input/output device or network traffic

## Advantages of Working with Streams

The Stream class (and derived classes) hide specific details of the operating system and the underlying devices

Streams help with avoiding large in-between variables
- Better for memory use
- Better for performance

A stream can be a coding-related concep

## Clarifying Streams

You can use a Stream at any level where youâ€™re writing code
- Client
- API

An API does not need to use a Stream for a client to benefit from using it, and vice versa

A stream can be a data transfer-related concept

Bytes come in streaming over HTTP/TCP
- Max 64kb
- Data comes in package by package

The API itself can also send parts of the response over the wire one by one as a continuous flow: streaming

## On Streams, Memory Use and Performance

Creating and disposing streams can cause some overhead
- You may see a direct impact on performance

Using streams ensures memory use is kept low
- Minimizing memory can also minimize garbage collection, which has a positive impact on performance
