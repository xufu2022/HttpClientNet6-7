# Supporting Cancellation

Learning why cancelling requests is important
- CancellationTokenSource
- CancellationToken

Implementation
- Cancelling a request
- Handling a cancelled request

HttpClient works with async tasks
- Cancelling a Task potentially frees up a thread

Task cancellation with HttpClient can happen
- When we request cancellation
- When a request times out

## CancellationTokenSource

An object which manages and sends cancellation notification to individual cancellation tokens

## CancellationToken

A lightweight value type passed to one or more listeners, typically as a method parameter

## CancellationTokenSource and CancellationToken

A piece of code that listens for cancellation monitors the IsCancellationRequested property of a token and acts accordingly 

Pass through a cancellation token when calling a method on HttpClient(e.g.: SendAsync())
- HttpClient will monitor the token and will not continue with a request when cancellation has been requested

## Cancelling a request

Initialization of a CancellationTokenSource


# Summary

Manually cancelling a Task helps free up threads that are no longer required
HttpClient will cancel the request (and thus Task) itself when a timeout is reached

Pass through a CancellationToken to parts of the code that need to listen for cancellation

Request cancellation via the originating CancellationTokenSource

Catch an OperationCanceledException to handle both types of cancellation
