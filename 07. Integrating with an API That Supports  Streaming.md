# Integrating with an API That Supports Streaming

## Streaming

A method of transmitting or receiving data over a network as a steady, 
continuous flow instead of all at once

## A Few Words on Supporting Streaming

IAsyncEnumerable<T> 
- Provides the ability to iterate over a set of values asynchronously

Since ASP.NET Core 6 System.Text.Json supports streaming, which, combined with IAsyncEnumerable<T>, can result in objects being streamed to the consumer

Support for HttpClient through
- IAsyncEnumerable<T> 
- Support for streaming in System.Text.Json
