# Supporting Compression

## Compression

Compressing data thatâ€™s sent of the wire makes it smaller, which results in reduced bandwidth consumption and, often, improved performance

A Few Words on Supporting Compression

The API (or whichever component is responsible for (de)compression) needs to support this
- gzip & deflate are common formats

When getting data:
- Set Accept-Encoding to the compression format you want to accept
- Enable automatic decompression on the SocketsHttpHandler

When sending data:
- Compress the data using a GZipStream or DeflateStream
- Set Content-Encoding to the compression format you used
