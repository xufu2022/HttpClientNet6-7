# Handling Faults and Errors, and Improving Resilience with Polly

## Inspecting Status Codes

EnsureSuccessStatusCode() throws an HttpRequestException on all but 2xx-level status codes 
- Depending on the actual status code we want to act differently

Level 400 issues are errors: the API correctly rejects the request

## Inspecting Response Messages

When an error happens, APIs can return additional information on that error in the response body
- Error messages
- Validation errors

Reading out the response body when streaming

## Improving Reliability and Resilience with Polly

Communication over a network is prone to mistakes and hiccups
- Often, simply retrying a request is sufficient

## Summary

Inspect the status code of a response for a more detailed approach to handling exceptions 

When working with streams, the response body of a failed request should be read out as a stream as well
- ProblemDetails
- ValidationProblemDetails

Use Polly to improve the resilience & reliability of your application
- E.g.: with a retry policy
